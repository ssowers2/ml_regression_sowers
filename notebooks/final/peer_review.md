## **Peer Review**

### Notebook Reviewed  
[Beth Spornitz – Medical Cost Regression Project](https://github.com/BethSpornitz/ml_regression_bethspornitz/blob/main/notebooks/regression_final/ml_regression_final_bethspornitz.ipynb)

**Did Beth's peer review contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb)?** Yes.

### 1. **Clarity & Organization**
Beth’s notebook is very well structured and easy to follow. Each section is clearly labeled from importing data, exploring patterns, engineering features, building models, and finishing with SHAP and the interactive tool. The reflections embedded throughout the notebook help explain her thought process, and the overall workflow is smooth and logical. Very organized!

### 2. **Feature Selection & Justification**
Her feature selection is thoughtful and well supported. Beth includes relevant original features along with a strong set of engineered features such as obesity flags, interactions, and age-squared. The justifications for each one make sense and show a clear understanding of how these factors behave in real-world medical cost prediction.

### 3. **Model Performance & Comparisons**
The model comparison is one of the strengths of her project. Beth clearly explains why standard scaling doesn’t change the linear regression results, and her table comparing the three models makes improvements easy to see. The polynomial model results are well interpreted, and the SHAP section adds depth by showing which features matter most and how they affect predictions.

### 4. **Reflection Quality**
Her reflections are detailed and demonstrate strong insight into both the modeling workflow and the dataset. She understands the strengths and limitations of each approach. One of the highlights of the notebook is the Interactive What-If Predictor she built—it’s a smart way to make the model more intuitive and user-friendly.

### Overall Feedback
Beth’s project is polished, easy to read, and technically strong. The use of polynomial regression, SHAP modeling, and the interactive prediction tool goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. I used the same dataset and was genuinely inspired by her approach. She went above and beyond, and I don’t have any major suggestions for improvement. This was excellent work, especially for a first regression project!
