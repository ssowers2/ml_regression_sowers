## **Peer Review**

1. **Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)**
2. **Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)**
3. **Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)**
4. **Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)**

The peer review must contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review. Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback. Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well. 
Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
